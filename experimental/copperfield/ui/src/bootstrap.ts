        ## Marked
        Marked is a speedy markdown processor that safely converts markdown formatted text into html.
        Writing markdown is easy! You can see all the formatting tricks [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

        To use the marked action, insert a string of markdown formatted text like so:
        \`+ marked ?my_markdown\`
        and read the parsed html like so:
        \`+ marked ?my_markdown = ?html\`

        \`+ parse ?kind ast ?ast from ?entity\`
        and read the unparsed code like so:
        \`raw ?kind code from ?entity = ?code\`
